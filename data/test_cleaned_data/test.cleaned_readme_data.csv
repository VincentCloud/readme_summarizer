4,136699628,https://api.github.com/repos/tenfinney/graphql-relay-js,A library to help construct a graphql-js server supporting react-relay., relay library for graphqljs this is a library to allow the easy creation of relaycompliant servers using the graphqljshttpsgithubcomgraphqlgraphqljs reference implementation of a graphql server build statushttpstravisciorggraphqlgraphqlrelayjssvgbranchmasterhttpstravisciorggraphqlgraphqlrelayjs coverage statushttpscoverallsioreposgraphqlgraphqlrelayjsbadgesvgbranchmasterservicegithubhttpscoverallsiogithubgraphqlgraphqlrelayjsbranchmaster getting started a basic understanding of graphql and of the graphqljs implementation is needed to provide context for this library an overview of graphql in general is available in the readmehttpsgithubcomfacebookgraphqlblobmasterreadmemd for the specification for graphqlhttpsgithubcomfacebookgraphql this library is designed to work with the graphqljshttpsgithubcomgraphqlgraphqljs reference implementation of a graphql server an overview of the functionality that a relaycompliant graphql server should provide is in the graphql relay specificationhttpsfacebookgithubiorelaydocsengraphqlserverspecificationhtml on the relay websitehttpsfacebookgithubiorelay that overview describes a simple set of examples that exist as testssrctests in this repository a good way to get started with this repository is to walk through that documentation and the corresponding tests in this library together using relay library for graphqljs install relay library for graphqljs when building a schema for graphqljshttpsgithubcomgraphqlgraphqljs the provided library functions can be used to simplify the creation of relay patterns connections helper functions are provided for both building the graphql types for connections and for implementing the resolve method for fields returning those types connectionargs returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that supports bidirectional pagination forwardconnectionargs returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that only supports forward pagination backwardconnectionargs returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that only supports backward pagination connectiondefinitions returns a connectiontype and its associated edgetype given a node type connectionfromarray is a helper method that takes an array and the arguments from connectionargs does pagination and filtering and returns an object in the shape expected by a connectiontypes resolve function connectionfrompromisedarray is similar to connectionfromarray but it takes a promise that resolves to an array and returns a promise that resolves to the expected shape by connectiontype cursorforobjectinconnection is a helper method that takes an array and a member object and returns a cursor for use in the mutation payload offsettocursor takes the index of a member object in an array and returns an opaque cursor for use in the mutation payload cursortooffset takes an opaque cursor created with offsettocursor and returns the corresponding array index an example usage of these methods from the test schemasrctestsstarwarsschemajs this shows adding a ships field to the faction object that is a connection it uses connectiondefinitionsnodetype shiptype to create the connection type adds connectionargs as arguments on this function and then implements the resolve function by passing the array of ships and the arguments to connectionfromarray object identification helper functions are provided for both building the graphql types for nodes and for implementing global ids around local ids nodedefinitions returns the node interface that objects can implement and returns the node root field to include on the query type to implement this it takes a function to resolve an id to an object and to determine the type of a given object toglobalid takes a type name and an id specific to that type name and returns a global id that is unique among all types fromglobalid takes the global id created by toglobalid and returns the type name and id used to create it globalidfield creates the configuration for an id field on a node pluralidentifyingrootfield creates a field that accepts a list of nonid identifiers like a username and maps them to their corresponding objects an example usage of these methods from the test schemasrctestsstarwarsschemajs this uses nodedefinitions to construct the node interface and the node field it uses fromglobalid to resolve the ids passed in the implementation of the function mapping id to object it then uses the globalidfield method to create the id field on faction which also ensures implements the nodeinterface finally it adds the node field to the query type using the nodefield returned by nodedefinitions mutations a helper function is provided for building mutations with single inputs and client mutation ids mutationwithclientmutationid takes a name input fields output fields and a mutation method to map from the input fields to the output fields performing the mutation along the way it then creates and returns a field configuration that can be used as a toplevel field on the mutation type an example usage of these methods from the test schemasrctestsstarwarsschemajs this code creates a mutation named introduceship which takes a faction id and a ship name as input it outputs the faction and the ship in question mutateandgetpayload then gets an object with a property for each input field performs the mutation by constructing the new ship then returns an object that will be resolved by the output fields our mutation type then creates the introduceship field using the return value of mutationwithclientmutationid contributing after cloning this repo ensure dependencies are installed by running this library is written in es6 and uses babelhttpbabeljsio for es5 transpilation and flowhttpflowtypeorg for type safety widely consumable javascript can be produced by running once npm run build has run you may import or require directly from node after developing the full test suite can be evaluated by running while actively developing we recommend running in a terminal this will watch the file system run lint tests and type checking automatically whenever you save a js file to lint the js files and run type interface checks run npm run lint license graphqlrelayjs is mit licensedlicense
