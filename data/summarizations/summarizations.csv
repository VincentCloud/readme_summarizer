数据源cell样式定制类：遵从jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议的类 指示器类：遵从jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议的uiview类 列表容器：官方推荐jxsegmentedlistcontainerview类，特殊情况可以使用uiscrollview自定义 指示器样式自定义 需要继承jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议，点击参看jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol 提供了继承jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议的基类jxsegmentedindicatorbaseview，里面提供了许多基础属性。点击参看jxsegmentedindicatorbaseview 自定义指示器，请参考已实现的指示器视图，多尝试、多思考，再有问题请提issue或加入反馈qq群 datasource和cell自定义 需要继承jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议，点击参看jxsegmentedviewdatasource

datasource和cell自定义，请参考已实现的datasource，多尝试、多思考，再有问题请提issue或加入反馈qq群 常用属性说明 常用属性说明文档地址 其他使用注意事项 其他使用注意事项文档地址 补充 如果刚开始使用jxsegmentedview，当开发过程中需要支持某种特性时，请务必先搜索使用文档或者源代码。确认是否已经实现支持了想要的特性。请别不要文档和源代码都没有看，就直接提问，这对于大家都是一种时间浪费。如果没有支持想要的特性，欢迎提issue讨论，或者自己实现提一个pullrequest。

datasouce类型为jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议。使用单独的类实现jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议，实现代码隔离。选择不同的类赋值给datasource，就可以控制jxsegmentedview显示效果，实现插件化。比如选择jxsegmentedtitleimagedatasource类作为datasource就选择了文字图片的显示效果；选择jxsegmentednumberdatasource类作为datasource就选择了文字加数字的显示效果； 3.初始化指示器indicator 4.实现jxsegmentedviewdelegate代理 contentscrollview列表容器使用示例 直接使用uiscrollview自定义使用示例 因为代码比较分散，而且代码量也比较多，所有不推荐使用该方法。要正确使用需要注意的地方比较多，尤其对于刚接触ios的同学来说不太友好。 不直接贴代码了，具体点击loaddatacustomviewcontroller查看源代码了解。 作为替代，官方使用强烈推荐使用下面这种方式👇👇👇。 配合jxsegmentedlistcontainerview封装类使用示例 jxsegmentedlistcontainerview是对列表视图高度封装的类，具有以下优点： 相对于直接使用uiscrollview自定义，封装度高、代码集中、使用简单； 列表懒加载：当显示某个列表的时候，才进行列表初始化。而不是一次性加载全部列表，性能更优； 1.初始化jxsegmentedlistcontainerview 2.实现jxsegmentedlistcontainerviewdatasource代理方法 3.列表实现jxsegmentedlistcontainerviewlistdelegate代理方法 不管列表是uiview还是uiviewcontroller都可以，提高使用灵活性，更便于现有的业务接入。 swift 如果列表是vc，就返回vc.view 如果列表是view，就返回view自己 returns 返回列表视图 func listview uiview return view 可选使用，列表显示的时候调用 func listdidappear 可选使用，列表消失的时候调用 func listdiddisappear 4.将关键事件告知jxsegmentedlistcontainerview 在下面两个jxsegmentedviewdelegate代理方法里面调用对应的代码，一定不要忘记这一条❗️❗️❗️ swift func segmentedview segmentedview jxsegmentedview didclickselecteditemat index int 传递didclickselecteditemat事件给listcontainerview，必须调用！！！ listcontainerview.didclickselecteditemat index func segmentedview segmentedview jxsegmentedview scrollingfrom leftindex int to rightindex int percent cgfloat 传递scrolling事件给listcontainerview，必须调用！！！ listcontainerview.segmentedviewscrollingfrom leftindex to rightindex percent percent selectedindex segmentedview.selectedindex 具体点击loaddataviewcontroller查看源代码了解 使用总结 因为jxsegmentedview本身支持许多特性：指示器、cell样式、列表容器等，如何有序管理好代码成了一个难题。借助于协议、继承、封装类极大的简化了使用难度，而且提高了灵活性，扩展相当容易。 核心主类：jxsegmentedview 数据源cell样式定制类：遵从jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议的类 指示器类：遵从jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议的uiview类 列表容器：官方推荐jxsegmentedlistcontainerview类，特殊情况可以使用uiscrollview自定义 指示器样式自定义 需要继承jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议，点击参看jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol 提供了继承jxsegmentedindicatorprotocol协议的基类jxsegmentedindicatorbaseview，里面提供了许多基础属性。点击参看jxsegmentedindicatorbaseview 自定义指示器，请参考已实现的指示器视图，多尝试、多思考，再有问题请提issue或加入反馈qq群 datasource和cell自定义 需要继承jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议，点击参看jxsegmentedviewdatasource 提供了继承jxsegmentedviewdatasource协议的基类jxsegmentedbasedatasource，里面提供了许多基础属性。点击参看jxsegmentedbasedatasource 任何自定义需求，datasource、cell、itemmodel三个都要子类化。即使某个子类cell什么事情都不做。用于维护继承链，以免以后子类化都不知道要继承谁了； datasource和cell自定义，请参考已实现的datasource，多尝试、多思考，再有问题请提issue或加入反馈qq群 常用属性说明 常用属性说明文档地址 其他使用注意事项 其他使用注意事项文档地址 补充 如果刚开始使用jxsegmentedview，当开发过程中需要支持某种特性时，请务必先搜索使用文档或者源代码。确认是否已经实现支持了想要的特性。请别不要文档和源代码都没有看，就直接提问，这对于大家都是一种时间浪费。如果没有支持想要的特性，欢迎提issue讨论，或者自己实现提一个pullrequest。
