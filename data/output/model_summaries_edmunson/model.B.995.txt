spaxxpos is a libraryservice for building a positioning with ad5311 magnetic sensors chips from austria microsystems how it works it builds a serial connection to an arduino board it uses a modified version of the columbo simple serial library httpcssl.sourceforge.net as an eventdriven serial reading 1 compile and build 2 using it as a shared library libcssl 3 running spaxxpos as a service 3 using libcssl event driven mode b starting c openig ports d setting flow cotrol e sending data f receiving data g changing port setup h errors i finishing blocking mode a notes b setting the timeout value c receiving data 2 compiling and linking your applications against libcssl first in your c files you should include libcssl.h include to compile and link your program against libcssl do for example as follows gcc wall o o myprogram myprogram.c lcssl you can use pkgconfig too wall o o myprogram myprogram.c 3 using libcssl event driven mode a write a callback function for example void callbackfunctionint id unit8t buf int buflen int i fori0ibufleni putcharbufi fflushstdout the callback function is executed when a data arrives on your serial port.
