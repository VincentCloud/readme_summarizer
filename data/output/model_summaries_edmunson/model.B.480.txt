how to speed up builds and tests what is taking most of the time in your builds cloning building testing improve cloning times by use a reference repository under advanced clone behaviors so that you can point to a local base repo instead of copying the entire history for every project you may also check out larsxschneiders cached clone script that also caches submodules and git lfs objects narrow refspec by selecting honor refspec on initial clone in advanced clone behaviors and specfying an appropriate refspec sparse checkout only the directories that are needed for the operation reduced repository sizes by moving large binary files to git lfs using bfgrepo cleaner push based build triggering use ngrok or open a port if needed get version control system server and artifact repository closer to the build server maybe by hosting it yourself or moving the build server closer to the rest improve build times by only building components once and transport them to all downstream build jobs and machines using an artifact repository for shared components ssds more cores and more memory optimized compiler switches mvn client vm parallel build options memory options use a build system that is caching build results globally and does build parallelization automatically improve test times by identifying which tests are still testing used functionality and disable the rest rewriting integration and system tests to use more mocking one process without ipc and file system interaction preferred analyze bottlenecks and silent exceptions using new relic dynatrace overops or just visualvm break monolythic applications done into multiple components that can be tested in isolation and only retested if they changed dedicate a person per team to improve test execution time test partitioning across multiple machines using jenkins parallel test executor plugin this repository ssds more cores and more memory learn more about jenkins pipelines its job resuming functionalities and its github integration if you like to use a presetup environment using docker that integrates with github.com you can follow this tutorial.
