unlike the original mnist dataset that offers only 10 possibilities i.e. 10 digits the fashionmnist provides a much more diverse classification problem 6. in this project we first reproduced the svc baseline for the fashionmnist classification problem in bhatnagar ghosal and kolekars paper 7. the svc baseline in the original paper achieved an accuracy score of 0.8970 whereas our attempt achieved a slightly higher accuracy score of 0.8986. then we used hyperparameter tuning to attempt to improve our model.
