therefore there are several goals to reach high performance zero allocation faster work than xmlwriter no runtime validation keep it simple no configuration allow write nonstring values without creation to intermediate string allow disable escaping values in similar way to newtonsoft.json produce as small as possible output xml easy migration from xmlwriter lightxmlwriter vs xmlwriter similarities method names are kept the same and they should work the same way for example for both writers produces both are not threadsafe both writers keep state so they must not be processed in parallel.
