adding structures to the assembly after creating the vtable virtuailor also adds a connection between the structure created and the assembly as you can see in the following images p.s the structure offset used in the bp is only relevant for the last call that was made in order to get a better understanding of all the virtual calls that were made the xref feature was added as explained in the next section xref to virtual functions when reversing c statically it is not trivial to see who called who this is because most calls are indirect calls however after running virtuailor every function that was called indirectly now has an xref to those locations.
