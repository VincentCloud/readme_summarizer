note currently the total num of moves in one iteration is counted using the number of steps the left leg takes so we are assuming here that the legs will always move if you are adding new moving body parts that will move add the refs to the relevant body parts see example of the legs if you need to add a new appearance to the body part you need to add a new stage name.
