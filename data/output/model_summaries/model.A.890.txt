to calculate the probability that an observation was emitted by a candidate a normal distribution is postulated i.e. the probability is pending on the distance between observation and candidate the standard deviation of the gnsserror and the expected value of the difference newson krumm 2009 4. the emission probabilities for each candidate are one part of the five tupel of a hidden markov model haenelt 2007 45 and the emission probabilities of the candidates of the first observation will be used as initial state probabilities in the hmm and represent another part of the five tupel raymond et al. 2012 2244. the expected value and the standard deviation can be set by the user.
