encryption certificates for https are exclusively generated on the system itself and not via thirdparty servers delivered robots.txt to prevent web crawlers from indexing a ccu in case it is accidently available from the internet general use of sha512 strong password hashes when entering a new ssh connection password in case of lowmemory conditions critical homematic services will be killed as one of the last services improved backuprestore functionality for manually running a backuprestore on the commandline createbackup.sh restorebackup.sh automatic nightly backups on a connected usb memory stick possibility to route nightly backups to external storage devices e.g. nas additional linux packages installedavailable wiringpi gpio library and commandline tools to easily queryset gpio states chrony as a dropin replacement for the old ntpd ntp daemon used jq json parsing commandline tool ethtool commandline tool to queryset information on network links f2fs f2fs filesystem which is explicitly developed for flash devices and can be used for e.g. external usb devices additional helper scripts useable on commandline triggeralarm.tcl – can be used to trigger an own alarm in the webui updateaddoncontig.tcl – to addremove ccu addon buttons to the webui automatic generation and update of dutycycle system variables which will contain the percentage of each rf module gpio module or connected lan gateways as well as automatic alarm triggering in case a duty cycle 98 is reached use of the raspberrypitinkerboard onboard leds to signal general system load using heartbeattyped led flashes a combination of multiple homematic rfmodules can be used to distribute dutycycle and allow for a wider range of different homematic access scenarios e.g. hmiprfusb and hmcfgusb2 at the same time support to be used as a pure homematic lan gateway hmlgwotwweu only support to be used without any gpio rf module hat when just connecting to a homematic lan gateway hmlgwotwweu selfcontained disk image targeted for lightweight embedded devices e.g. raspberrypi asus tinkerboard based on latest buildroot 2019.02.2 lightweight linux operating system latest linux kernel raspberrypi 4.19.36 tinkerboard 4.19.40 with hardfloat armv7 support support to boot system using an external usb memory stick or hard disk raspberrypi3 only or from internal emmc storage asus tinkerboard s supports onboard wifi of raspberrypi3 raspberry pi zero w or asus tinkerboard as well as various thirdparty usb wifi sticks supports onboard bluetooth of raspberrypi3 raspberry pi zero w or asus tinkerboard as well as various thirdparty usb bluetooth sticks supports network ups tools nut setups including usb connection to uninterruptible power supply ups as well as remote nut server use e.g. via synology nas network ups functionality support for the following thirdparty hardware attached on top hat boards s.usv – ups including alarm notification upon power loss and automatic system shutdown.
