rpiunboxing how to unbox a raspberry pi and get it ready for mercers kitchen projects reminder organize your sd cards give them to mr. mercer labeled inside your usb sd readerwriter and he will return it the next lesson note this document written with github markup list tool use in paper form or readme.md form see httpsgithub.commercerskitchenmarkdownreadmedocumentation for more information preparation rpi should be on ethernet connection until bios and wifi configured note unboxed settings are great britain not canadian wifi is never preferred for stability and security reasons general hardware setup full setup then headless ensured putty tightvnc and x11vnc headless is done with outside ip not 169.254.xxx.xxx bridged connection through network connections notes about passwords saving wifi credentials i.e. user name and password on a pi can be looked up especially if password is not changed all rpis have same default username and password published world wide md5 hashing is an available method that can be accessed through the terminal beyond the scope of this document steps unbox and install all hardware as indicated use an sd card readerwriter to install raspbian os have this ready download raspbian os accessed 20190530 making the process faster download free download manager accessed 20190605 mercerskitchen used fdm5x64setup.exe use it to download raspbian os able to use torrent do not use to catch all downloads from chrome drag and drop url to download rightclick in webpage on download link copy url in fdm click url should populate from clipboard change folder start download save the download to a parent folder on the cdrive makes imaging the sd card easier due to write distances check sha256 accessed 20190605 see instructions from httpsgithub.commercerskitchenbyodmd5checksumfileintegrity use cmd copy command and change the verify the checksum output in notepad website answer with downloaded answer locate the raspbian os installation documentation accessed 20190606 for additional software and instructions ensure sd card is empty see sd formatter new cards might work with a quick format error will only show at very end of installation means you would have to start all over again best practice use the overwrite feature caution ensure the drive letter is correct before formatting use file explorer to verify note if sd formatter doesnt work format the sd card to fat23 4gb max file size or ntfs larger file size available in windows 10 write the file to the sd card see raspberry pi for latest recommendation see balenaetchersetup1.4.9x64.exe includes great installer accessed 20190606 instructions for are part of the design for etcher a huge positive also has a github repo for those wanting to contribute optional win32diskimager accessed 20190606 instructions are here accessed 20190606 lesson interruption if the lesson is interrupted put the sd card into the card reader and label the card reader with the students name return everything the next lesson with a rpi to connect locally rpi complete sd card installation see apt on rpi documentation accessed 20190530 configure with gui and follow the prompts set the following as of 20190607 country canada language canadian english timezone edmonton use us keyboard click next optional change password caution security issue hide characters means password hashed setup screen ensure geometry is ok wifi skip update software skip until we have headless network access click restart click raspberry top right corner preferences raspberry pi configuration interfaces tab enable ssh enable vnc localization tab ensure all are set correctly bridge connections on laptop to rpi requires ethernet cable windows key wifi change adapter options network connections bridge ethernet with wifi use ctrl key rightclick verify ipv4 is bridged through eth0 ethernet port not bridged address 169.254.xxx.xxx 10.xxx.xxx.xxx or 127.0.0.xxx bridged address anything other than or open terminal update os reading of package dates must be done before installation of any software or upgrade install x11vnc server note password is needed when not in a secure lan ensure software is installed on the laptop putty tightvnc putty accessed 20190607 standard installation tightvnc accessed 20190607 caution ensure server feature is unavailable on the laptop installation custom install xout the server execute putty on laptop enter the socket and connect will need the username and password of the rpi in the terminal execute x11vnc record the port number given execute tightvnc on the laptop enter the socket and connect will need the port number given by x11vnc through the terminal of putty using the ssh protocol remember the port number for x11vnc 5900 or 5901 you now have a headless connection with the raspberry pi using a virtual network alternate method to tightvnc x11vnc is chrome extension real vnc real vnc in raspberry pi configuration optional verify configuration in all settings were ok 20190305 note verify expanded memory advanced options run expand memory to entire card ok 20190305 update upgrade reboot and clean os to most current linux packages note updateupgradereboot should be completed every time rpi is started x sudo apt update x sudo apt upgrade x sudo reboot x sudo apt clean note to make all xlines sudo elevate from username to root caution as superuser shell no protection exists from mistakes ... so do not make any or do not use this method if you are unsure x sudo su x exit cleaner output note typing sudo when already at root does nothing redundant install x11vnc on rpi to use with tightvnc viewer over local lan connection for tightvnc viewer instructions for a windows os see mercers kitchen byod repository and tightvnc viewing .exe downloadable possible other headless methods to find ip address of rpi using arp command on windows machine x arp a x sudo arp a angry ip scanner solarwinds ip tracker my lan viewer x sudo nmap ss 192.168.1.024 login to the router and look up the ip table specific instructions change depending on the router note rpi as a wireguard server must be left on ip from router should be static look up how to configure static ip address do not use any dhcp service should be turned off on the router and rpi wireguard or router application additional step enabling rpi ipv4 forwarding piraspberrypi sysctl net.ipv4.ipforward return net.ipv4.ipforward 1 if you did that then routing on the pi is enabled so thats good.
