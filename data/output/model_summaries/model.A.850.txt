once they are chosen you define the curl object as follows julia h dictproxy http regarding the functioning of http.jl you might need to modify another option to change the dbeditor.nomics.world url from https to http see httpsgithub.comjuliawebhttp.jlpull390 julia dbnomics.optionssecure false set the connection up for a session the curl connection can be set up for a session by modifying the following package option julia dbnomics.optionscurlconfig h after configuration just use the standard functions of dbnomics.jl e.g. julia df1 rdbids amecozutnea19.1.0.0.0.zutn this option of the package can be disabled with julia dbnomics.optionscurlconfig nothing use the connection only for a function call if a complete configuration is not needed but just an on the fly execution then use the argument curlconfig of the functions rdb and rdb... julia df1 rdbids amecozutnea19.1.0.0.0.zutn curlconfig h use the standard functions readlines and download to retrieve the data dbnomics.jl can also use the standard functions readlines and download.
