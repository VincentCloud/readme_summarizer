four use cases list all tags in pi archive list all attributes in pi af retrieve recorded values for an arbitrary number of tags for an arbitrary time range per tagattribute retrieve interpolated values for an arbitrary number of tags for an arbitrary time range per tagattribute features no size limit for individual tags utilizes a configurable number of threads and makes one rpc call per tag per page utilizes a configurable page size and handles joining pages together internally writes data for each tag to a separate file alternatively split output files into subfolders by year month or day automatically handles exceptions and retries failed calls one tag throwing an exception e.g. due to a corrupt archive does not affect download of other tags all actions log information to a configurable file as well as to the console or the gui when given a user interrupt signal exits cleanly at the conclusion of the tags currently in progress which may take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the time range and tag frequency.
