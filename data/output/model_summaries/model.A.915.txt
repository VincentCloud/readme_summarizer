the symbols imported by the prelude are bitfield provides an analogue of c bitfields bitorder translates semantic indices to bit positions within memory bitslice specialization of bool bitstore describes the unsigned integer types used to store bits bits conversion traits from rust types to mut bitslice lsb0 a bit ordering from least significant up to most significant local the local c bit ordering msb0 a bit ordering from most significant down to least significant word the local cpu word size additionally when targeting a system where alloc is present the prelude adds the following bitbox specialization of boxbool bitvec specialization of vec bitbox a veclike macro which constructs bitboxes bitvec a veclike macro which constructs bitvecs code sample this snippet highlights a selection of library functionality.
