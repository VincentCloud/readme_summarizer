features an opensource software architecture for photonic quantum computing a fullstack quantum software platform implemented in python specifically targeted to the cv model quantum circuits are written using the easytouse and intuitive blackbird quantum programming language includes a suite of cv quantum computer simulators implemented using numpy and tensorflow these builtin quantum compiler tools convert and optimize blackbird code for classical simulation future releases will aim to target experimental backends including photonic quantum computing chips installation strawberry fields requires python version 3.5 and 3.6 we are unable to support 3.7 until tensorflow also supports 3.7. installation of strawberry fields as well as all dependencies can be done using pip .. codeblock bash python m pip install strawberryfields if you are using the tensorflowgpu module for tensorflow gpu support you can install the following package for gpu support in strawberry fields .. codeblock bash python m pip install strawberryfieldsgpu getting started to see strawberry fields in action immediately try out our web application.
