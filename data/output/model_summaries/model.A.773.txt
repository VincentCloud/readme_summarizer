the plugin calculates the immediate dominator tree and immediate postdominator tree of the function control flow graph and looks for the situations where the idomi j and ipdomj i. this means all paths from the function start to node i must go through node j and all paths from j to the function terminal must go through i. a candidate isolated subgraph thus starts at node j and ends at node i. for each candidate isolated subgraph the plugin further verifies only the entry node has predecessor nodes not in the candidate subgraph.
