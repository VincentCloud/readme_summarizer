lets say that screen 0 is 1920x1080 and screen 1 is 1280x1024 screen 1 is on the left of screen 0. to separate the screens screen 0 must be far from screen 1 at least the value of screen 1 width1 1281 so 3000 is fine the example below shows the same setup as before but screen 1 is on the right of screen 0. screen 1 is far from screen 0 the value of screen 0 width1 1921 but 3000 would still be fine yet this configuration is necessary to be able to lock the mouse pointer inside one screen which would otherwise be free to travel to the other one.
