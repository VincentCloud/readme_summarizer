the string tables could be fuzzed as well z. its up to you to decide how badly you want to corrupt an elf once the orcs have been created inside the orcs dir its time to test them with the help of testfuzzed.sh where you can simply specify the name of the folder with the orcs to be run os loader testing or add an extra parameter to specify which program and its parameters youd like to test against every malformed elf within the orcs folder.
