i dont think that tradeoffs that were made to win benchmarks are worth it so ive created ivi library it is using all the good parts of the kivi library and is all about developer productivity without any benchmark specific optimizations it wont be able to win all benchmarks but it really doesnt matter because winning benchmarks is not just optimizations in a library benchmark implementations for the fastest libraries are implemented in nonidiomatic ways and libraries are mostly optimized for this nonidiomatic code that nobody would ever write.
