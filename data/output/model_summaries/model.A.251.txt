key features of the score clustering algorithm unsupervised no prior number of clusters stable with automated selection of stability and resolution parameters through scanning a range of search windows for each run together with a boostrapping aggregation approach to determine stable clusters fast with rcpp implementation score first builds a reference cluster the highest resolution and then runs iterative clustering through 40 windows or more in the dendrogram resolution is quantified as the divergence from reference by applying adjusted rand index stability is the proportional to the number of executive runs without rand index change while changing the cluster search space optimal resolution is the combination of stable and high resolution bagging algorithm bootstrap aggregation can detect a rare subpopulation which appears multiple times during different decision tree runs key features of the scgps algorithm estimates transition scores between any two subpopulations scgps prediction model is based on elastic net procedure which enables to select predictive genes and train interpretable models to predict each subpopulation genes identified by scgps perform better than known gene markers in predicting cell subpopulations transition scores are percents of target cells classified as the same class to the original subpopulation for cell subtype comparision transition scores are similarity between two subpopulations the scores are average values from 100 bootstrap runs for comparison a nonshrinkage procedure with linear discriminant analysis lda is used scgps workflow scgps takes scrna expression datasets from one or more unknown samples to find subpopulations and relationship between these subpopulations.
