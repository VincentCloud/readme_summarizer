stuff i.e. making the car learning how to optimally drive there are several engineering improvements to be considered such as for example nonexhaustive list in no particular order set up unit and integration tests reuse node gateway for multiple cars at the same time a better abstraction for driving policies so that it becomes easier to instantiate custom policies while keeping the rest of the code i.e. communication layer pretty much intact and reusable a carlevel abstraction on top of the current overdrive class so that we could easily simulate different hardware abilities and constrain car learning in dynamic ways data ingestionpersisting mechanism so that we can log in a reliable and consistent way everything that happens within a run some experimental code will be published in the develop branch and hopefully merged later on into a beta release.
